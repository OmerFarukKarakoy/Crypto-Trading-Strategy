# Crypto-Trading-Strategy

## Overview

The **Crypto Trading Strategy 3 Bot** is an AI-powered trading system that uses **RSI**, **EMA**, and **WaveTrend** indicators to identify market trends and generate buy/sell signals. It also includes an **LSTM-based model** to forecast future prices and offers **Turkish-language recommendations** with visual analysis support.
The bot provides recommendations based on a four-tier signal system:

üü¢ "G√º√ßl√º Al" ‚Üí Strong Buy: All indicators (RSI, EMA, WaveTrend) confirm a bullish signal.

üü¶ "Temkinli Al" ‚Üí Cautious Buy: Core indicators (EMA and WaveTrend) align positively, but RSI does not confirm.

‚ö™ "Bekle" ‚Üí Wait: EMA and WaveTrend give conflicting signals (e.g., one BUY, one SELL). RSI is ignored.

üüß "Temkinli Sat" ‚Üí Cautious Sell: Core indicators (EMA and WaveTrend) align negatively, but RSI does not confirm.

üî¥ "G√º√ßl√º Sat" ‚Üí Strong Sell: All indicators (RSI, EMA, WaveTrend) confirm a bearish signal.

This structure ensures clarity and precision in trading decisions, allowing users to quickly interpret the strength and direction of market signals in real time.
